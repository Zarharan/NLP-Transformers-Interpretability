# NLP Transformers' Interpretability

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to use NLP explanation/interpretability tools. In this project, I use the stance detection task, but you can change it to your own custom NLP task if you wish. This repository will be updated in the future, but for now, I just use [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) as an explanation tool.
